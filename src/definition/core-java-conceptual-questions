Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to create programs that implement specific algorithms.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK is a superset of JRE, and contains everything that is in JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications. JRE provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.
So it includes:
The Runtime Interpreter.
The Compiler.
The Applet Viewer.
The Debugger.
The Class File Disassembler.
The Header and Stub File Generator.
The Documentation Generator.
Applet Demos.

What is IDE?
A. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

Explain the entire java life cycle.

Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source code in a text editor to the point that source code is converted into machine code (0’s and 1’s).

There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:

Editing the program
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code
First, we start with typing the program in a text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc). After completing editing of the program, we have to save the file. While saving the file we should remember that the file must be saved with .java extension. For example, let’s think that I had written a Java program which contains a single class Sample. It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.

Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in Sample.java. The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file will be Sample.class.

Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?

Class is blueprint of an object.

What is object?

Object is instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?

The main method is the entry point of a Java application. Specifically、when the Java Virtual Machine is told to run an application by specifying its class (by using the java application launcher), it will look for the main method with the signature of public static void main(String[]);

Why main is static?

This is neccesary because main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made. Since it is static it can be directly invoked via the class. Similarly, we use static sometime for user defined methods so that we need not to make objects. void indicates that the main() method being declared does not return a value.
